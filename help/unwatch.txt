# LEAGUE (optional*)
  The league argument is optional when deregistering a watcher. If omitted, all watchers that match the other arguments will be removed. To specify a league, simple enter the league's id or name found on LeagueGaming.com. The leagues currently supported by ${config.name} are:
      * ${Object.keys(leagues).map(id => {return `${(leagues[id].name + ' '.repeat(13)).substr(0,13)} (id: ${leagues[id].id})`}).join('\n      * ')}

  If specifying a league by name, be sure to wrap it in quotes (ex: "LGHL PSN") or remove any spaces (ex: LGHLPSN).

# TEAM (optional)
  The team argument is optional when deregistering a watcher. If omitted, all watchers that match the other arguments will be removed. To specify a team, simple enter the team's id or name found on LeagueGaming.com. Some examples of these are:
      * ${Object.keys(teams).slice(0,5).map(id => {return `${(teams[id].name + ' '.repeat(27)).substr(0,27)} (id: ${teams[id].id})`}).join('\n      * ')}

  If specifying a team by name, be sure to wrap it in quotes (ex: "Toronto Maple Leafs") or remove any spaces (ex: TorontoMapleLeafs).
