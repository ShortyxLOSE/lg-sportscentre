Hello ${message.author.username}! Here is what you need to know about ${config.prefix} watch:

# SYNTAX

# LEAGUE (required)
  To register a watcher with ${config.name}, you must specify a supported league from LeagueGaming.com. ${config.name} does not support leagueless watchers at this time. To specify a league, simply enter the league's id or name found on LeagueGaming.com. The leagues currently supported by ${config.name} are:
      * ${Object.keys(leagues).map(id => {return `${(leagues[id].name + ' '.repeat(13)).substr(0,13)} (id: ${leagues[id].id})`}).join('\n      * ')}

  If specifying a league by name, be sure to wrap it in quotes (ex: "LGHL PSN") or remove any spaces (ex: LGHLPSN).

# TEAM (optional*)
  The team argument is optional for all types except games. ${config.name} does not support teamless game watchers. To specify a team, simply enter the team's id or name found on LeagueGaming.com. Some examples of these are:
      * ${Object.keys(teams).slice(0,5).map(id => {return `${(teams[id].name + ' '.repeat(27)).substr(0,27)} (id: ${teams[id].id})`}).join('\n      * ')}

  If specifying a team by name, be sure to wrap it in quotes (ex: "Columbus Blue Jackets") or remove any spaces (ex: ColumbusBlueJackets).

# CHANNEL (optional)
  If you want messages from this watcher sent to a specific channel, tag it at the end of the command. If none are specified, messages will be sent to the server's default channel.
