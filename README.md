Originally written as a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) webhook powered by a series of [PHP scripts](http://php.net/), **Duthie Bot** (code name: lg-sportscentre) has been reinvented as a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Providing features such as game updates, news tracking, and daily star reporting, **Duthie Bot** is the perfect addition to your [LeagueGaming.com](http://www.leaguegaming.com) EA NHL team server.

Dependencies
============
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.11.3

 * [request](/request/request) >= 2.83.0
 * [node-cron](/kelektiv/node-cron) >= 1.3.0

How to Use
==========
To get started using **Duthie Bot**, you'll first need to authorize it to use your server. To accomplish this, go to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=356076231185268746&scope=bot&permissions=0, select the server you're adding it to, and click "Authorize".

Once **Duthie Bot** has been added to your server, you will need to grant it permission to "Read Message" and "Send Messages" for any channel(s) you want it to have access to. Once **Duthie Bot** is able to read and send messages, you can begin configuring your update watchers.

From a channel **Duthie Bot** has access to, send the message `-lg help` to get started. This section will be expanded to include detailed instructions over time.
